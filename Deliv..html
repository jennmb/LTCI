<p title="Staring Out" style="font-family:times new roman; color:white;">Before attening this class the only experience I had with coding was editing my profile, and sometimes my friends' profile on myspace.
I would change the sizes, font, and color of text, make new/remove coulums, also edit the text that appears in the tooltip (little white box that appears under the mouse).
I was in middle school at the time. I did not know what it was I was working on; however, it was not until resently that I learned
what I was doing was similar to html. Because I had previous experences, I was moved onto Ruby.
