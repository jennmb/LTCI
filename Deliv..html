<p style="font-family:time new roman; color:black; text-indent:30px;">After working with HTML for a while, I went on to learn Ruby. I can't say exactly what Ruby is, but I can explain what I have experienced Ruby can do. I noticed that it mainly focuses on files, such as opening them, printing its contents out on the command line, inserting information, and doing some basic math.</p>
<p style="font-family:time new roman; color:black; text-indent:30px;">I used the book, <ins>Learn Ruby the Hard Way</ins> by Zed Shaw. In the beginning it was tedious typing the same code. I continued on with the exercises and learned to do more with Ruby, rather than just using "puts".</p>

<p style="font-family:time new roman; color:black; text-indent:30px;">The concept of the words and symbols used to write code in Ruby are similar to other programming languages. For example, I recently got a glimps of how to code on Swift, and saw similarity between the two. Both used functions and variables, as well as the symbols used to do math.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:rgb(0, 62, 255);"><em>right shows the coding for the script</em></p>

<p style="font-family:time new roman; color:black; text-indent:30px; padding-bottom:20px;">Before I was a bit hesitant about learning to code because I thought that it was going to be extremly difficult. Once I got the hang of it and practiced more and more I find it a lot of fun and now more eager to learn the other programming languages.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:times new roman; font-size:125%; color:black;">Attending My First Meet Up</h3>

<p style="font-family:times new roman; color:black; text-indent:30px;">Meetups are these get-togethers coders go to, you're either working on something of you'r own or you shadow someone. Shadowing means to be beside another fellow coder and take note of how and what they are doing. This is a great place to get to know other coders, but most importantly to learn new material and get answers that you've had answered.</p>

<p style="font-family: times new roman; color:black; text-indent:30px;"> When I got to my first meet up I was a bit nervous. Mostly because I am relatively new to coding. I thought, "Oh, these people are pros, they're probably going to find it bothersome explaining everything that should be basic knowledge for coders." Luckly, the organizers of the meetup offered to go around and help those who need it. There were also a few people that were beginners like me.</p>

<p style="font-family: times new roman; color:black; text-indent:30px; padding-bottom:20px; border-bottom:2px solid black;">During the meetup I got to work on a website that teaches the fundamentals of Swift. Others at the meetup were also working on the same thing, and we all asked question and helped each other in areas where we did not understand. I noticed that it was a place with great atmosphere. Which made me feel relaxed and focused. Everyone got along great, happily helping one another or allowing them to observe what they were working on.
