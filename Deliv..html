Before attening this class the only experience I had with coding was editing my profile, and sometimes my friends' profile on myspace.
I would change the sizes, font, and color of text, make new/remove coulums, also edit the text that appears in the tooltip (insert picture of tooltip).
I was in middle school at the time. I did not know what I was doing; however, it was not until recently I learned
what I was working on was html. Because I had previous experience, I was moved onto Ruby.
